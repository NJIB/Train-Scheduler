# Train-Scheduler 
https://njib.github.io/Train-Scheduler/

This application demonstrates the usage of a Firebase database as well as Moment.js to manipulate time calculations and formats.

The user inputs the name, destination, first train time and frequency.  The application then takes this information, stores it to the Firebase database, and also then performs a function to show how many minutes remain until the next train will arrive (based on the first train time, current time, and frequency).  This information is then all written back to a table on the screen, appending a row for each new entry.

The application uses Javascript and jQuery for the core functionality.
